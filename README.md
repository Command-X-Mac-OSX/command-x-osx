## What is Command X?  

**Command X** is an intuitive **Finder enhancement utility** that introduces true *cut and paste* functionality to macOS. Instead of copying files, you can now move them directly using the familiar `âŒ˜ + X` and `âŒ˜ + V` commands â€” bringing a feature long appreciated on other platforms to the Mac experience.  

This lightweight utility integrates natively with Finder, preserving the clean macOS interface while adding new flexibility for power users. It simplifies file management, enabling you to move, organize, and rearrange items faster than ever before â€” without cluttered menus or extra steps.  

Command X works flawlessly with **keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop actions, and multi-file selection**. Itâ€™s designed for users who prefer speed, precision, and simplicity in their daily workflows.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, the app runs efficiently in the background and consumes minimal system resources, making it a must-have utility for users who rely heavily on Finder navigation and file organization.
